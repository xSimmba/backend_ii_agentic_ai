            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

a = Singleton()
b = Singleton()
print(a is b)
```
- Explanation: Both instances refer to the same object.
- Discussion: Briefly mention other patterns (Factory, Observer) for context.

    -  Define a simple function (e.g., compute a square).
    - Create and start multiple processes.
```py
import multiprocessing
import time

def compute_square(n):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a heavy computation
    print(f"Square of {n} is {n*n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    processes = []
    for number in numbers:
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=compute_square, args=(number,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()
    for p in processes:
        p.join()

```
- Explanation: Each process runs independently, and joining ensures all complete before the script ends.

### Exercise:

- Problem: Create a program that concurrently computes the factorial of several numbers using multi-processing.
- Steps to Solve:
    - Define a recursive factorial function.
    - Spawn a process for each number in a list.

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(task_function("Task 1", 1))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(task_function("Task 2", 2))
    results = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

- Handling Timeouts:
    - Use asyncio.wait_for to set timeouts.
```py
    async def timeout_task():
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        return "Completed"

    async def main_timeout():
        try:
            result = await asyncio.wait_for(timeout_task(), timeout=1)
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            result = "Task timed out"
        print(result)

    asyncio.run(main_timeout())
```

- Commit and Push: Commit the file and push to GitHub to trigger the workflow. Explanation: This workflow checks out your code, sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs tests using pytest.

### Exercise:

- Problem: Create a GitHub Actions workflow that tests your project on multiple Python versions.
    - Steps to Solve: Modify the YAML file to include a matrix strategy for Python versions.

### Challenge:

- Problem: Extend the CI/CD pipeline to include a deployment step that runs only when code is pushed to the main branch.
    - Hint: Use conditional steps and job dependencies.
 

## Project Module: Agentic AI backend solution

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a robust Python backend solution that integrates advanced AI agent capabilities (via Crew AI). The solution should enable efficient handling of complex tasks by delegating responsibilities to AI agents, while ensuring seamless integration with traditional backend services provided by frameworks such as Django, FastAPI, or command line tools (CLIs).

- Key aspects:
    - Innovation: Demonstrate how AI agents can be utilised to improve decision making and automate backend operations.
    - Integration: Seamlessly combine Crew AI’s agent framework with Python-based backend services.
    - Scalability: Create a solution that can be scaled to support increased data loads and concurrent user requests.

### Goal

- The overall goal of the project is to implement an integrated backend system with the following targets:
    - Robustness: Deliver a dependable solution that reliably processes and responds to API requests.
    - Performance: Optimise backend performance and response times by using asynchronous processing where appropriate.
    - Extensibility: Ensure the system is modular and can be extended with additional AI functionalities or services in the future.
    - User Experience: Provide clear and user-friendly interfaces (e.g. API documentation, CLI tools) that facilitate easy interaction with the backend.

### Requirements

To achieve the objective and meet the project goal, the following requirements must be addressed:

#### Functional Requirements
    
- AI Agents Integration:
    - Utilise Crew AI to manage AI agents responsible for tasks such as data analysis, real-time recommendations, or process automation.
    - Develop clear interfaces for communication between the backend and the AI agents.

- Backend Service Implementation:
    - Use Python as the primary language.
    - Choose one or more frameworks (Django, FastAPI, or CLI-based solutions) to implement the core backend services.
    - Implement RESTful API endpoints to expose the system’s functionalities.

- Data Management:
      - Integrate a reliable database solution (e.g. PostgreSQL, SQLite) for persistent data storage.
      - Ensure secure data access and proper management of user sessions/authentication if required.

- Security & Error Handling:
    - Incorporate proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
    - Implement security best practices (such as input validation, authentication, and authorisation).

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: The system should handle increasing loads gracefully with provisions for scaling up services.
- Performance: Optimise the backend for latency-sensitive operations, particularly where real-time AI decision-making is involved.
- Maintainability:
    - Codebase should follow standard coding conventions (e.g. PEP8).
    - Adequate inline comments and external documentation should be provided.
- Testing:
    - Develop unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
    - Incorporate automated testing and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) where possible.

### Deliverables
